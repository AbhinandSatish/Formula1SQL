Previously, no more than 80 litres of fuel in a single tank is allowed, meaning most cars required 3 separate fuel tanks, usually 2 bag tanks either side of the driver's cockpit and another fuel tank behind him. However, this requires multiply fuel lines for the various tanks, and it is the shearing of the fuel lines in impacts that causes the fires of Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson and Niki Lauda. Therefore, the central single fuel tank pioneered by Lotus becomes accepted as a safer option to stop fuel lines from side impacts being sheared and igniting.",,,
